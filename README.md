# GCSE Level 01 Problem 04 Dice Face
## Display the face of a dice using ASCII characters.

When making games that only use text it is nice to add some visual appeal using what is known as “ASCII Art” – pictures made from text characters. We could show the face of a dice using this technique.

Write a program to output the number 5 face of a dice only using the ASCII characters: o, # and a space.

## Success Criteria

- Remember to add a comment before a subprogram to explain its purpose.

- Complete the subprogram called `output5` so that:
1. It outputs the face of a dice using o and # characters.

## Typical inputs and outputs would be:

> ooooooooooo
> o         o
> o  #   #  o
> o    #    o
> o  #   #  o
> o         o
> ooooooooooo
